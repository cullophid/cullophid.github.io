					  I am a <b>contractor</b> with extensive experience with web technologies.
					  I am from Denmark, but I have lived in London since March 2012.

					<p class="animate" style="opacity: 1;">
						In 2014 I co-founded Sentia Analytics. Sentia Analytics analyses retail stores in order to optimize profit margins. By applying image analysis to CCTV camera feeds we collect data on customer movement. We then combine this with point-of-sales data to provide a holistic analysis of the stores performance. Because Sentia is a part-time project, I have had to ensure that the project is state of the art when it comes to automation. The deployment for the sentia dashboard is fully automated, and every commit goes through a vigorous automated testing pipeline before being deployed to production.
					</p>
					<p class="animate" style="opacity: 1;">
					  One achievement I am particularly proud of is my work at Inxite.
					  While working there we rewrote their entire application using Node.js and MongoDB. It was still early in my career
						but considering I was the most experienced javascript developer on staff, I got to take the lead in architecting the new product.
					  During this process I had to sample dozens of web frameworks and server libraries to assemble our software stack.
					  I was also tasked with writing apps for both Android and iPhone.
					</p>
					<p class="animate" style="opacity: 1;">
					  In 2012 I wrote my Masters thesis on machine learning in intelligent buildings.
					  The thesis investigated the possibilities of integrating machine learning algorithms into modern home control systems.
					</p>
					<p class="animate" style="opacity: 1;">
						From 2010 to 2011 I co-founded a startup company called jollytime.dk.
						Though jollytime.dk never became a financial success, I acquired plenty of useful experience.

					<div class="none">
						<p><b>Director and full stack developer, Sentia Analytics, Feb 2014 - </b>
						In February of 2014 I co-founded Sentia Analytics. Sentia Analytics provides in-store analytics for retail store owners by analysing CCTV camera feeds and point-of-sales data. The Sentia Analytics dashboard is built on the MEAN stack.
					</p>
						<p><b>Full Stack Developer, Armakuni. May 2015 - Sep 2015</b>
							At armakuni I worked on a project for Edupreneurs who wanted a cloud based solution for streamlined education enrolment. Armakuni is a cutting edge agile company that practices continuous delivery and fullly automated testing and deployment. The system was architected as a set of microservices, and I was responsible for the Node.js API and front-end javascript.
						</p>
						<p><b>Full Stack Developer, Rightmove. Feb 2015 - Apr 2015</b>
						At Rightmove I worked on project ODIN. Rightmove is changing their infrastructure to microservices and project ODIN is a complete rewrite of their property search.
						As part of my role at righmove I would advise them on front-end technologies, design patterns and best practices.
						The role involved mostly front-end work, with sass and knockout, but also substantial server side work with java and Spring.
					</p>
					<p> <b>Full Stack Developer, Blinkbox Music.Nov 2014 - Feb 2015</b>
						At Blinkbox Music I worked on their music streaming service.
						This included everything from front-end work in Javascript and css, back-end work in Java/Spring and Ruby, python for testing and task automation.
					</p>
					<p> <b>Node.js Developer, Adstream. Jul 2014 - Oct 2014</b>
					At Adstream I worked on their public facing API. Adstream is a global leader in their field. It is important that their public API is state of the art when it comes to both performance and security. I also built an infrastructure for automated server-side workflows using Apache ActiveMQ.
					</p>
					<p> <b>Backend Developer, Signal-noise. May 2014 - Jun 2014</b>
					I worked as a contractor on an intensive two month project building a data visualisation tool for the mobile company EE. We used Node.js with SailJS and PostgresSql to build a webservice that can process large amounts of data within a very short time. To achieve this we had to optimize every bit of the request pipeline, from using Redis for faster session management, to replicating the data into preaggregated SQL tables. It also meant analyzing every bit of javascript code, to squeeze out more performance.
					</p>
					<p> <b>Lead web developer, Inxite. Mar 2012 - Apr 2014</b>
					I played a key role in rebuilding their product. This involved architecting the system, deciding on technologies and frameworks, designing a database schema, and designing the API. On the back-end I decided to use Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. Front-end we used jQuery, Jade, Less and Bootstrap. While working for Inxite I also wrote apps for both Android and IOS. These were Native wrappers for a mobile html5 app.
