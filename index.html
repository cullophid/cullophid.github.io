					<p>I am currently finishing my M.Sc. in computer science at the Technical University of Denmark. I am taking the remaining ECTS 	points as a part time course, which will terminate in july 2012.
					</p>
					<p>In february, I finished my master thesis on Machine learning in intelligent buildings. The thesis was a study in the possibilities on integrating machine learning algorithms into modern home control systems.
					</p>
					<p>From 2010 to 2011, i had the opportunity to be partner in a small startup company called jollytime.dk. During this time i was the lead software developer, and had the opportunity to utilize my acquired skills in both web development, and project management. Though jollytime.dk never became a financial success, the experience of working with an interdisciplinary team of developers, was very educational.
					</p>
					<p>I find myself fascinated with software development because I am constantly confronted with new problems, that often requires new and unique solutions. I believe that a good engineer is one who sees every problem as an opportunity for finding new creative solutions. With the challenges developers face today, the need for creativity, and the ability to think out of the box, has never been greater. I consider both of these skills to be my greatest strengths. I am a great communicator, and I believe communication is the most important think when working in a team. I do my best work with people who inspire and challenge me, and I strive to do the same to others.
